# Pulsar Star Classification
This is a project for the course Machine Learning in Physics in which we will train a supervised machine learning model to predict whether or not a candidate is a pulsar star.

## Dataset
The dataset used to train and test the model comes from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/colearninglounge/predicting-pulsar-starintermediate.
